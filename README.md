# Flood_Separation_Tool
Flood events extraction from continuous hydrographic data.

Many hydrological projects and research topics require flood events analysis. Flood events Have be extracted from continuous time series of discharge. In this work, the separation of flood events is performed with a simple algorithm. This algorithm simplifies the task of extracting hydrological events and offers much flexibility to calibrate and improve the efficiency of the flood separation. Moreover, the tool adds to the selection a second variable (e.g. suspended-sediments concentration). The algorithm automatically generates a hydrograph plot to ease and speed up the validation process. The tool does not require any training, but may require some basic hydrologic knowledge concerning baseflow and the minimum peak for the calibration.
